    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name implies, Binary search is an algorithm that finds an element in a given collection. It has two requirements:\n",
    "1. The elements in the data structure should stored in a sorted order.\n",
    "2. The data structure storing the elements should allow random access to elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "It works as follows: At each step, it compares the middle element in the search space with the target value. If they are equal, it returns the index of the middle element. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues on the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater, the search continues on the upper half. The process continues until the search space is empty or the target element is found. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the algorithm reduces the search space by a factor of 2 each step, its overall runtime becomes Log(n) (where the base is 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Following are different question patterns that can be solved using Binary Search\n",
    "1. **Searching an element in a sorted array or list**: This is the most straightforward application of the algorithm.\n",
    "2. **Rotated Arrays**: Problems involving rotated sorted arrays often lend themselves to solutions using binary search, for example finding a target value in a rotated array.\n",
    "3. **Finding boundaries**: Binary search can be used to find the first or last occurrence of a value in a sorted array, or to determine the lower or upper bound of a range.\n",
    "4. **Optimization problems**: Some optimization problems can be solved using binary search, especially those which require finding a specific threshold or breakpoint within a given range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at sample problems/questions for the each of these patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching an element in a sorted array or list\n",
    "**Question**: For a given array check if it contains two elements whose sum is equal to 0. If yes, return the two elements\n",
    "array: [1, 2, 3, 4, -2, 6, 7] answer: Yes, elements (2, -2)\n",
    "\n",
    "While this question can be solved in linear time by using a hash set to keep track of the elements seen so far and then for each new element checking if their complement exists in the set or not. We can also employ binary search to come up with O(nLogn) solution, which is still better than the brute force O(n^2)"

The simplest way to find the pivot point would be to use a linear search which will take O(n) time, so using linear search for the pivot point would not lead to the most optimal solution as the linear search will dominate the overall runtime. \n",
